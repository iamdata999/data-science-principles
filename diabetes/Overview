Deploying machine learning models to managed online endpoints is crucial for 
enabling real-time predictions in applications such as fraud detection and health 
monitoring. Using Azure Machine Learning, this process becomes efficient and 
user-friendly with MLflow, which simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for 
custom environments or scoring scripts. Azure's managed endpoints ensure high 
availability, scalability, and reliability, while providing an environment for testing 
and validating models before production. Additionally, Azure facilitates resource
cleanup to manage costs effectively. This integration supports seamless predictive 
analytics and efficient resource management, enhancing overall model deployment and utilization.
